				Restaurant Description.<br />
				Conformity is the greatest enemy toward garment cuisine in the hotdog industry. Here at Sizzling<br />
				Hotdogs we combat this enemy by having our customers suggest changes to our menu. Each menu item <br />
				rotates every six months in order to ensure fresh and new creations can be explored. But, donâ€™t worry if <br />
				you have a favorite that is no longer on the menu, you can special request this item for a small fee. Each <br />
				ingredient used is decided by quality and not by price. Since Sizzling Hotdogs is committed to non-<br />
				conformity our restaurant is situated in the middle of a residential area. This home/business helps <br />
				customers feel more relaxed in a traditional setting, like eating a meal at home. So, come down to <br />
				Sizzling Hotdog for your dog today. Remember that parking is <strong>extremely</strong> limited.
